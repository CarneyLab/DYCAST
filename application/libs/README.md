Notice!

These two libraries (dbfpy and psycopg2) are necessary for the operation of the DYCAST system, but they were not developed as part of DYCAST and were not created by the DYCAST authors. They are included here purely as a convenience.

The dbfpy project (http://dbfpy.sourceforge.net/) has been released into the public domain.

The psycopg2 project (http://initd.org/psycopg/) is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. More information about the license is available here: http://initd.org/psycopg/license/
